#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

Features and improvements.


= Planned =

Listed in order of priority:
  * Better initialisation of the double-triangle. The initial point set should be processed in linear order, first constructing an edge and then the double-triangle, removing redundant points at each stage.
  * Better implementation of 2d convex hull using the quickhull algorithm
  * Implement the rotating caliper method for determining OBB from convex hulls (2D & 3D)
  * Better subdivision of triangle set for constructing OBB tree
  * Clean up collision detection (GJK) and collision response code


= Done =
